We're sitting around watching a <a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=a2HWzsXIaAY'>video on youtube</a> of "strikeouts", which is where you take a bong hit and hold it in, chug a beer, take a shot, and then exhale.  Tony says, "I bet bird flu will put an end to this."

Everyone else says, "Bird flu?  WTF?"

Tony says, "Who would want to share a bong with bird flu running around?"
