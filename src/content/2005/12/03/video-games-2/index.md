<i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>: Excellent.  It's longer than <i>Ico</i>, with more action, and just as beautiful and intriguing.

<i>Ratchet: Deadlocked</i>: Disappointing.  They kind of phoned it in on this installment, I think.  The story was virtually non-existent.  I didn't find the weapons to be as entertaining.  Maybe I'm just getting tired of this series.  I haven't tried the multiplayer support.

<i>SSX On Tour</i>: Satisfying.  The snowboarding gameplay is largely the same as in <i>SSX3</i> (except for the ubertrick system), but on a new set of runs.  I haven't tried skiing yet.

<i>Guitar Hero</i>: Satisfying.  Almost excellent.  The guitar controller makes it easy for non-video-gamers to get into this game.  However, for the hardcore gamer this game falls short of <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i>.  DDR has an extensive practice mode, and GH desperately needs a similar mode.
