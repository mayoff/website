title: How to get a $1550 discount on a flat-panel TV

1.  Own a TV stand that takes about 7.75 square feet of floor space.
2.  Buy a house for $200 per square foot.
3.  Buy a flat-panel TV and mount it on the wall.

You have now reclaimed approximately $1550 worth of square footage.

(No, I haven't bought a new house yet.)
