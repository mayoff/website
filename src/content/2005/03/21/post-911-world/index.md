I've noticed that you hear words like "post-9/11-world" a lot from the Bush administration.  What does that mean, exactly?  Every action that the terrorists are willing to carry out now, they were willing to carry out on September 10, 2001.  The terrorists didn't change on 9/11.  The administration did.  All "post-9/11-world" means is, "since the administration pulled its collective head out of its collective ass and realized that terrorism is a serious, immediate issue".  So every time you hear Bush or Cheney or Rice say "post-9/11-world", ask yourself why his or her head was in his or her ass in the first place.
