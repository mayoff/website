<i>Ultimate Spider-Man</i>: Disappointing.  I was hoping for a game that would improve on [the <i>Spider-Man 2</i> experience](/2004/07/06/spider-man-2-the-game/).  This didn't.  The graphics are fine - I like toon shading.  The story is very short, and not nearly as good as <i>Spider-Man 2</i>'s.  The controls and the fighting are vastly simplified from <i>Spider-Man 2</i>.  There is almost nothing in the way of ability upgrades, unlike <i>Spider-Man 2</i>.

<i>We &hearts; Katamari</i>: Satisfying.  There's nothing revolutionary here, but there are some nice new features. Katamari Damacy left me wanting more, and this meets that desire well.  The soundtrack is not as good, though.

<i>Sly 3: Band of Thieves</i> Satisfying.  I thought the original <i>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Racoonus</i> was pretty good, and I thought <i>Sly 2: Band of Thieves</i> was great.  This is a lot like <i>Sly 2</i>, but the clue bottles are gone, you get to play several extra characters with neat abilities, and the mini-games are quite fun.  Also, remarkably, Sly's special attacks work against the bosses, which is pretty unusual in my experience.

I'm looking forward to <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> (from the creator of <i>Ico</i>), and I'll probably buy <i>SSX On Tour</i> and <i>Ratchet: Deadlocked</i> too.  Yes, I've noticed that five of these six games are sequels.
