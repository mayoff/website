title: More 2405FPW

I've been so spoiled by the Dell 2405FPW on my desk at work that I just ordered one for home (about $780 before tax thanks to a 35% deal that expires today).  Now I have to decide whether to sell my 2001FP (20.1" 1600x1200 LCD) or buy a PCMCIA video card so I can connect both to the Powerbook simultaneously.

Meanwhile, others at the company liked the 2405FPW enough that the company bought nine more of them.

Oh yeah, and the replacement for the defective 2001FP arrived Monday, right on schedule.
