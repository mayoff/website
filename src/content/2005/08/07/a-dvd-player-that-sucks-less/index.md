Remember the good old days, when you'd rent a video tape, put it in the VCR, and fast forward through the FBI idiocy and the trailers to the movie?  Now you get a DVD from Netflix but you can't skip the FBI idiocy, and sometimes they even throw in some non-skippable ads.  Then you have to watch a menu animate onto the screen, select "Play Movie", and watch the menu animate back <i>off</i> the screen.  I hate Hollywood so much.

My savior has arrived in the form of a GoVideo VR3845.  This combination DVD-recorder and VCR has a feature called "Autoplay".  You put in a DVD and it automatically skips the FBI blah, the ads, the trailers, and the menu and just <i>plays the movie</i>.  Brilliant!  I've only tested it on one DVD so far (<i>Igby Goes Down</i>) but it worked like a charm.
