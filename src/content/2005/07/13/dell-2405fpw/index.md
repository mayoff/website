At my office I've been connecting a Sony 20" 1600x1200 LCD monitor to my Powerbook.  However, this only lets me put two 80-column Terminal windows side-by-side.  There's more horizontal space, but not enough for a third 80-column terminal.  (Not at my preferred font size, anyway).  So I ordered a Dell 2405FPW, which is 24" and 1920x1200.  It has enough room for a third terminal.

Most of the other LCDs around the office are Apple displays, but the Dell displays have a few advantages.  First, they're cheaper.  Second, the Dell stands are much more flexible.  Third, the Dells have four USB ports.  Fourth, the Dells support VGA, S-Video, and composite video inputs in addition to DVI.  The 2405FPW also supports component video and has four memory-card reader slots.  The only advantage of the Apple monitors is that they have a Firewire hub, but nobody here needs that.

My 2405FPW arrived Tuesday.  The stand is height-adjustable and rotates, unlike the Apple stand.  In addition, it supports rotating the monitor 90 degrees, into "portrait" orientation.  MacOS X supports this (you set it in the Displays system preference pane), so I decided to try it just for fun.

It turns out that this is totally awesome.  Here's what it looks like:

I actually had a sense of vertigo looking at the monitor this way.  The viewable area is about 20.5 inches tall.  What sold me on this arrangement is that I can now get <i>four</i> tall (57-line) 80-column terminals on the screen with no overlap:
