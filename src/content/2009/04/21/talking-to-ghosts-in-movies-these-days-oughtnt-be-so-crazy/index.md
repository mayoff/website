title: Talking to ghosts in movies these days oughtn't be so crazy.

We just watched <em>Ghost Town</em>, in which (surprise!) Bertram Pincus (the main character) can see and hear ghosts.  So he talks to them and of course in various scenes he gets funny looks.

All he need do is wear a bluetooth headset.  It doesn't even have to be turned on.  Everyone will just find him annoying, not nutty.
