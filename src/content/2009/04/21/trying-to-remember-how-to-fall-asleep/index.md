title: Trying to remember how to fall asleep

Every night of late I lie awake trying to remember how to fall asleep.  I go through periods where I fall asleep easily and periods where I don't.

When I was a senior in high school, one of my friends was a Japanese foreign exchange student named Tetsuya Toyoda.  He was in orchestra.  I can't remember if Tetsuya was a cellist, but he invited me to go to a performance by a cellist (with piano accompaniment).  So we went to some auditorium and listened to the cellist play.  Well, Tetsuya listened.  I listened for a while and had a very hard time staying awake.  Eventually I just gave up and went to sleep.

Maybe I can hire a cellist to play me to sleep each night.  Or maybe Delia would like cello lessons.
