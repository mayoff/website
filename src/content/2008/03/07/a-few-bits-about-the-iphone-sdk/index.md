Regarding today's release of the iPhone SDK:

- The SDK disk image is 2.1 GB and includes Xcode 3.1 (beta).
- Interface Builder is not supported yet.
- You must get a crypto certificate to actually install apps on an iPhone.  You get one by joining the $99 developer program.  I have "applied" for the program but have not yet received the email allowing me to actually pay for a membership.  You can run apps in the iPhone simulator without a certificate.
-   The code for the sample applications is installed on your hard drive here:
