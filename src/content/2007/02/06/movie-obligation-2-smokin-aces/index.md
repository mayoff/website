This movie was not worth my time.

Going to the movie theater sucks.  It costs more than seeing a movie at home.  At home, I can eat whatever I want.  At the Alamo, the only thing on the menu that I find appetizing is the pepperoni pizza, which isn't what I want to be eating.  I can't pause or rewind to hear missed dialogue, get a drink, or use the toilet.
