A month or two ago, at a charity auction, Delia won the use of a 3 bed, 3 bath suite at the Franz Klammer Lodge in Telluride for 12/14 through 12/21 (both Fridays).We missed our 9 AM flight on 12/14 and were forced to reschedule for a 7:40 AM flight on 12/15.  Yargh.We made the Saturday flight and arrived at the lodge at about 3 PM and rushed to get in one run with our new gear.We had dinner at 9545 (a restaurant named for its elevation).  Delia went to bed as soon as we got back.  I went to bed around 10 PM (11 PM Austin time).  Our room has a Tempurpedic mattress.  I've never been on one before.  It was weird.
