This post is way behind schedule.  Movie #9 was *King of Kong*, which was great.  Movie #10 was *Blade Runner The Final Cut*. It's been so long since I saw any other cuts that I couldn't remember exactly what was different, other than noticing that Bryant's explanation of the situation had been changed to account for all six replicants instead of just five as in the original cut.  Fortunately Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner#The_Final_Cut_.282007.29">a list of the changes</a>.
