It's not that I haven't tried to have fun.  Summer, Delia, and I took a sailing class yesterday.  Today Tony and I each took a little catamaran out on the sound.  There's some fun to be had sailing, but (at least the way we did it) there's a lot of boredom too.  At least out in the sound there are no biting insects (at least during daylight).

You might think that at least way out here, away from the infernal noise machine*, I'd get some peace and quiet, hearing just the air conditioner and the waves.  Nope.  The bass line of something from down at the pub (I guess) makes it all the way up to our room.

I hate it here.
