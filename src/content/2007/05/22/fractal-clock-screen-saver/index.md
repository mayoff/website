title: Fractal Clock Screen Saver

I have written a MacOS X screen saver called <a href='http://dqd.com/~mayoff/programs/FractalClock'>Fractal Clock</a>.  Enjoy.
Enjoy, damn it!

This was inspired by an article on the Wolfram blog, wherein
Theodore Gray asks, "<a href='http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/05/why_spend_more_than_five.html'>Why Spend More Than Five Minutes on a GUI?</a>"  The obvious answer is, "Because you don't have $2500 to spend on Mathematica."

I do have Mathematica, and Tree Bender is a fun toy, but another answer to Theodore's question is: Mathematica is slow.  My native version runs a lot faster.  Also, you can't write a screen saver in Mathematica.
