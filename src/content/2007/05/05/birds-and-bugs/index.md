title: Birds and Bugs

I was stopped at a light on the way to work when I saw a bird land on the sidewalk, pull a bug out of a crack, and start eating it.  Presumably, birds find bugs tasty.  That's a weird thought.  When a bird grabs a bug in its beak, and crunches down, and the bug shell cracks, and bug goop squirts out onto the bird's tongue, does the bird think, "Yum, I want some more of that!"?  I'm not sure how to punctuate the end of that last sentence.
