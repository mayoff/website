Remember when your were five or six, and you'd visit your aunt or grandmother.  You didn't really understand her relationship to you, but for some reason she'd insist on grabbing you and giving you a big kiss, or kisses, and you really did not like the closeness and just wanted to get away?  That's what the humidity here is like, but you can't get away and it never stops.

That's not entirely true.  Fortunately, Delia booked us an air-conditioned room.  In the room, it's cool and dry.

BUT, the bathroom is <em>not</em> air-conditioned.  It's connected to the outside by screened shutters, so leaving the bathroom door open just lets the conditioned air leak out.  So you don't, and going to the bathroom feels like going outside.  This can't be good for my kidneys.
