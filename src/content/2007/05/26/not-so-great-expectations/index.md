title: Not-so-great Expectations

I always have two expectations when I travel:

<ol>
	<li>I will be miserable.</li>
	<li>I will spend a lot of money.</li>
</ol>

I expect this trip (to the Bitter End Yacht Club, or BEYC) to be no different.  In fact, I've been filled with a nameless dread.  But I shall overcome this nameless dread.  By naming it.  Dread, I hereby dub thee "Crognar".

It doesn't help that our flight is at 7:50 AM.

I fully expect the following events:

<ul>
	<li>Our flight out will be delayed and we'll sit on the tarmac for two hours.</li>
	<li>We will miss our connection in Atlanta.</li>
	<li>The puddle-jumper from San Juan to Tortola will not have in-flight beverage service.</li>
	<li>The ferry from Tortola to BEYC will have mechanical difficulties, leaving us drifting aimlessly.</li>
	<li>Somehow, I will end up stranded on a tiny island, but unlike Tom Hanks, I will have no volleyball to befriend.</li>
	<li>Shark attack.</li>
	<li>Loss of an appendage (due to shark attack).</li>
	<li>A plague of biting insects.</li>
	<li>Seasickness.</li>
	<li>Identity theft.</li>
</ul>

Then, on the second day, I will be killed by pirates.  Actually, that may come as a relief.

In summary, goodbye cruel world.
