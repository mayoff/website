I was bitten thrice while waiting for the ferry to BEYC before I dug the DEET out of the suitcase.  I hate spraying poison on myself, not to mention being sticky and smelly (more so than usual anyway), and (because of DEET on my hands) being unable to take out my Invisaligns to drink the fruit smoothie Delia brought me.
