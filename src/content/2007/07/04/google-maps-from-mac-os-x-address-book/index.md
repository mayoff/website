title: Google Maps from Mac OS X Address Book
wordpress_id: '79'

The Mac OS X Address Book (as of Tiger at least) makes it easy to send an address to MapQuest.  I've packaged a little AppleScript that sends it to Google Maps:<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="Google%20Maps%20Address%20Book%20Plug-In.dmg"><img src="googlemapof.png" width="173" height="100" alt="googlemapof.png" /></a>

Click the picture to download the script.  Put the script in your `Macintosh HD:Library:Address Book Plug-Ins` folder or the `Library:Address Book Plug-Ins` folder in your home folder.  Then restart Address Book.
