We saw <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</em> on Saturday.  I liked it.  John didn't.  He thought the plot was too complex, and he didn't care about the characters.  I thought the plot was just right, and although I didn't care much about the characters either, the plot was interesting enough to make up for it.

On the other hand, we were sitting in front of some loud-mouthed retards.  We probably will not be going to the south Tinseltown again.  It seems to attract that sort of cretin.

Delia and Todd like to assign numeric ratings to movies.  I don't think that it's possible to assign just one rating to a movie.  The problem, as I pointed out on Saturday, is that sometimes you're in the mood for a certain type of movie, and other times you're not.  When you're not in the mood, you won't like the movie as much.  I felt vindicated on Sunday when John admitted that he might have been overly harsh about the movie because he wasn't really in the mood for an action/adventure film on Saturday.
