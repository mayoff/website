We saw <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> on Sunday.  Spider-pig was the funniest bit.  There were some other funny bits, but it didn't have the humor density of a typical 30-minute episode.

Watching <em>The Simpsons</em> in a theater with strangers of varying ages was interesting.  The twelve-year-olds laughed loudly at all of the tired old jokes I got sick of twenty years ago.  I guess that's why Hollywood keeps putting them in.  Many of the bits I found funniest didn't seem to get much of a reaction from the rest of the theater.

Also, strangely, people kept wandering in to the movie for about 30 minutes after it started.  Fortunately the theater was pretty empty so they didn't have to make a big fuss finding a seat.
