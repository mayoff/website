I hate going to movies at the theater, but to get John to come to RGM, I agreed to go to twelve movies at the theater.  Today I went to the first: <i>Children of Men</i> at the Alamo South.  We got there late enough to have to take seats in the third row at the far left.  I had a caesar salad with chicken.  The movie was OK.  It's one of those gritty near-future settings, but less technology-driven than most I'm familiar with.  After, we ran into JB and his brother, who'd been seeing the same movie.
